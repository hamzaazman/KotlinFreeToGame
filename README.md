# Tech Stack
- **Jetpack**
  - **Flow**: Flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
  - **Lifecycle**: Lifecycle is a series of callbacks executed in a certain order when the status of the activity or fragment changes.
  - **View Binding**: View binding is a feature that allows us to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - **ViewModel**: ViewModel class is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- **Hilt**: Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android
- **Coil**: Image loading for android by kotlin coroutines
- **Navigation Components**: Navigation is a framework for navigating between destinations within an Android application that provides a consistent API whether destinations are implemented as Fragments, Activities, or other components.
- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is a type-safe REST client developed by Square for Android, Java, and Kotlin.
